## Deployment Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Full production deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Show deployment status
./scripts/deploy-production.sh -s

# Run deployment tests
./scripts/deploy-production.sh -t

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deploy-production.sh -r
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-all.sh

# Run specific test types
./scripts/test-all.sh -b  # Backend only
./scripts/test-all.sh -f  # Frontend only
./scripts/test-all.sh -e  # E2E only
```
