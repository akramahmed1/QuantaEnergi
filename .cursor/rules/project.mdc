# Core Rules for Cursor AI
- Always break down complex tasks into small, sequential steps.
- If stuck, stop and output a to-do list before proceeding.
- Check for errors in each step: Lint, test, and verify.
- Use minimal context: Only reference necessary files.
- If generation takes >30s, suggest simplifying the prompt.
- For bugs: Describe the issue, hypothesize causes, then fix one at a time.---
