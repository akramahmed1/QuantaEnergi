# Core Rules for Cursor AI
- Always break down complex tasks into small, sequential steps.
- If stuck, stop and output a to-do list before proceeding.
- Check for errors in each step: Lint, test, and verify.
- Use minimal context: Only reference necessary files.
- If generation takes >30s, suggest simplifying the prompt.
- For bugs: Describe the issue, hypothesize causes, then fix one at a time.

# Anti-Stuck Rules for EnergyOpti-Pro
- Break all tasks into numbered steps: 1. Plan in a temp.md. 2. Implement one file/change at a time. 3. Test/verify.
- If generation takes >30s or loops, stop and output: "Paused for review. Summarize progress."
- For bugs/stucks: Hypothesize cause (e.g., large file), suggest fix (e.g., split task), then proceed minimally.
- Reference only specified files; ignore unrelated code.
- After each step, ask: "Confirm to continue?" (but auto-proceed if clear).
- End with commit message as specified.
