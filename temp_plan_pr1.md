# PR1: Restructure Folders and Add Infrastructure - Plan

## Step 1: Create new folder structure
- Create `/infrastructure/` with placeholders
- Create `/shared/` with types
- Move services to appropriate locations

## Step 2: Implement folder creation/moves only
- No code changes yet
- Just reorganize file structure

## Step 3: Update imports in backend/app/main.py
- Limit to 2-3 files only
- Fix import paths

## Step 4: Add .gitignore with standard ignores

## Step 5: Commit changes

## Anti-stuck rules:
- If any step takes >30s, pause and summarize
- Work on one file at a time
- No large refactors at once
