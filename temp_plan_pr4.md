# PR4: Add Technical Patterns and Testing - Plan

## Step 1: Plan technical patterns implementation
- Rate limiting in main.py
- Concurrency in quantum_service.py
- Error handling across services
- Test expansions

## Step 2: Update main.py for rate limiting only
- Add rate limiting middleware

## Step 3: Update quantum_optimization_service.py for threading only
- Add concurrency patterns

## Step 4: Enhance logging/fallbacks in 2-3 services
- Focus on IoT and other services

## Step 5: Add/expand tests
- One file at a time
- Run pytest --cov after

## Anti-stuck rules:
- Work on one file at a time
- If any step takes >30s, pause and summarize
- Keep changes incremental
- Run tests after each major change
